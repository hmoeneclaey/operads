# Formalising an A_\infty Operad in Two-Level type theory 


## Data.agda

Contains logical connectives, natural numbers, equality and isomorphisms, along with some basic properties

## FiniteSet.agda

Contains a definition of (small) finite totally ordered sets as sets isomorphic to a canonical finite set.

Main results :

     - The finite union of finite sets is finite

     - Explicit description of the order on these unions

     - Some morphisms of finite totally ordered sets

## Operad.agda

Contains the definition of ns-operads, together with endomorphism and monoid ns-operad

## FibrantUniverses.agda

Contains the definition of the fibrant structure, along with basic porperties

## HomotopyTransfer.agda

Contains the proof that fibrant algebras are invariant by equivalence for cofibrant operads
